# 30 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my repository for the **30 Days of Code Challenge**! This project is a collection of daily coding exercises and solutions designed to enhance and practice the skills I developed during my coding bootcamp.

## Overview

The 30 Days of Code Challenge is an initiative to consistently practice coding and problem-solving skills over a 30-day period. Each day presents a new coding problem or task, which I solve using various programming concepts and techniques. This challenge covers a range of topics including algorithms, data structures, and more.

## Structure

- **Daily Challenges:** Each day features a new problem statement along with my solution. Problems vary in difficulty and scope.
- **Code:** Solutions are implemented in Java.
- **README Files:** Each day's solution is accompanied by a README file explaining the problem, my approach, and how to run the code.

## Skills Practiced

Throughout this challenge, I've focused on:
- **Algorithmic Thinking:** Improving problem-solving skills and algorithm design.
- **Data Structures:** Applying and optimizing various data structures.
- **Programming Languages:** Leveraging the syntax and features of [your programming languages].
- **Debugging:** Enhancing my ability to identify and fix issues in code.
